This was the best decision she made in her life.  <br \/><br \/>For the past three years, Ruth has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense farming knowledge she has, farmers from her village now seek technical advice from her on the best dairy farming techniques. Ruth is the primary breadwinner in her family, and she carries out her responsibilities with great passion. She is pushed to make great efforts in attending her duties so that her children can have a comfortable life. <br \/><br \/>Although this humble and persistent mother makes a profit, she faces the challenge of not being able to produce enough to meet the ready market that is available. Therefore, she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm inputs like good fertilizer and good quality seeds so that she can expand her mixed farm. <br \/><br \/>Through this loan, Ruth will double her production, and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming. This loan will help Ruth to realize her dream of getting out of poverty, and she will be able to secure her family's future.",    "translated_description": "Ruth (pictured here wearing a white blouse alongside her farming neighbour) is a smart and humble young lady who has a great desire to change her life.
